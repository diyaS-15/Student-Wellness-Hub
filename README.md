# Student-Wellness-Hub
Contributors: Diya Shrivastava, Kajal Ranjan 

## Project Description
Our project is a student wellness hub, complete with motivational. Although, there are a lot of study hubs out there, much too often they can feel over complicated and overwhelming. Our intention with this project was to make organization for students easier and less complex, while maintaining and monitoring student mental well-being. 
To achieve these goals, we created features like the mood tracker, to do list, self-care tips, and integrated lofi playlists. An additional motivation was being students ourselves. Often, we noticed that there was a lack of a simple all inclusive study hub where we could see our tasks while reminding ourselves to not get stressed. 
We mainly aim provide the user with the reasources to maintain a balance between academic and wellness. It provides the user with motivational quotes, an area for them to access their music and track their mood. This aims to reduce stress within the student wellness hub, and ensures that the user has options to access self-care. 

## What we learned 
Throughout this hackathon we focused on both learning and strengthen our skills with Next.js and TailWindCSS. We worked with MongoDB to store our mood rating. Additionally, we learned about npm, Node.js, integrating API Keys, and working with GitHub. Lastly, we researched into FastAPI and Flask but have not fully integrated that yet. 

## Challeneges we faced
During the last 24 hours, we faced more challenges than initially aniticipated. The primary challenges were regarding AI models and the best way to integrate them into the project. Initially we had planned to generate AI powered sentiments from the virtual pet, automatic generation of self-help tips, and sentiment analysis for mood tracking. We faced issues with the API calls for popular AI models like openai and gemini as they reuqired payment and issues with integrating a python backend framework.

## Future Integrations
Moving forward, we plan integrate NLP Sentiment Analysis of the mood tracking data, integrate the virtual pet interactions like pop-up compliments, and integrate academic support features like note summarization. Additionally, we would like to focus on a backend framework like FastAPI moving forward with the project.
