# Student-Wellness-Hub
Contributors: Diya Shrivastava, Kajal Ranjan 

## Project Overview
Our project is a student wellness hub that provides a centralized hub for supporting mental well-being while studying. As students we have experimented with different study hubs to reduce the number of distracting platforms open, however these platforms have not been able to provide us with the simplicity and convience we sought out. With this webapp, we integrated our favorite study features along with motivational student support to help prevent burnout. Some key features include mood tracking, to-do list for task tracking, an embedded calming study playlist, and aesthetic UI components to display the time and self-care tips. 

Tech Stack: Implemented the front end using Next.JS, styled using TailWindCSS. For the mood tracking feature, implemented storage in MongoDB. 

Challenges: Some challenges we faced included finding free api keys for AI model usage, implementing the backend using FastAPI properly and some issues with the Next.js environment. 

Future Implementations: 
 - Interactive virtual pet with AI generated compliments.
 - Sentiment Analysis with stored user moods.
 - Academic support features like pop-up whiteboard, note summarization and quiz question generation. 
 - Random generation of self care tip.
